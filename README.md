# Snap Pix

![Look](./look.gif)

Scripts for doing some fun stuff with images.

## Scripts for the Pi

Put these scripts on the Raspberry Pi. Log in via ssh and trigger the camera by running them.

* "snap-pic.sh" - snap an image using the Raspberry Pi webcam

* "snap-schedule.sh" - same as above -- but keep on snapping


## Processing scripts

I run this "conversion" on my laptop after I've picked out a set of images I think might make a good animation.

* "convert.sh" - converts a set of images to a gif. Be sure to set the SOURCE and DEST as needed.
